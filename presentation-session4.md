## Shiny_advanced instructions

### 01_data_prep-solution.R
- run the code to create ./data/_.csv, ./data/_.rds, and ./data/_.xlsx
- check that Belgium_export-site.csv contains the right data
- modify the script to add RSV and Flu to the existing sars data flow
- subset dates after 01/09/2025
- due to the improvement of analytical method, the labProtocolIDs after this date are "SC_COV_5.0", "UA_COV_5.0", "SC_PMMV_3.0", "UA_PMMV_3.0", "SC_INF_2.0", "UA_INF_2.0", "SC_RSV_2.0" and "UA_RSV_2.0"
- import flu data with read.csv("https://data.geo.be/ws/sciensano/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&VERSION=2.0.0&TYPENAMES=sciensano:wastewatertreatmentplantsinfluenza&outputFormat=csv")
- import rsv data with read.csv("https://data.geo.be/ws/sciensano/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&VERSION=2.0.0&TYPENAMES=sciensano:wastewatertreatmentplantsrsv&outputFormat=csv")
- match the metadata of ./Belgium_export-nation-sc_flu_rsv-fake.csv

### 02_visuals.R
- load and use ./Belgium_export-nation-sc_flu_rsv-fake.csv until the 01_data_prep.r script is ready
- adapt date_reporting to last Monday, date_graph_start to 01/09/2025, date_graph_end to 01/09/2026
- write a function to save a graph for sars, rsv and flu

### 03_tbl.R
- load and use ./Belgium_export-nation-sc_flu_rsv-fake.csv until the 01_data_prep.R script is ready
- save a table showing last ten dates of the national viral ratio with the last date being the date_reporting defined in 01_data_prep.R
- display only sampling days which are Mondays
- save a table for sars, rsv and flu. this table will be added in the report

### 04_quarto.R
- modify scripts to display the targets in dedicated sections with graphs and tables

### app_V1.R
- Perform the Shiny_basic instructions
- load and use ./Belgium_export-nation-sc_flu_rsv-fake.csv until the 01_data_prep.r script is ready
- Add "Flu", "RSV" tabs displaying the graphs at the national level and at the site level

### Adapt 00_main.R code to
- start doing this 45 min before the session end
- ask each team member to commit their change and push it to the online repository
- source all scripts in the 00_main.R
- make sure to load all packages needed in 00_main.R only
- commit and push the modifications
